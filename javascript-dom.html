        <h1>What is javascript?</h1>
            <p>Javascript is ACTION, it allows a website to be more interactive and dynamically change. It can change the CSS and HTML 
        allowing what is display to user a change based on input or certain action on the site. Using the analogy of a car the Javascript
        is the engine. The HTML provides the stucture and defines the number of seats, how many lights, how many windows whilst the 
        CSS determines how all of those elements are styled on the car e.g. 2 in the front, 3 in back with colour of them being black.
        CSS my define the windows to be closed. Then when Javascript comes along it provides the action which causes windows to go up,
        the car to move when accelertor is pushed and other actions which makes a car functional. In a magical world it would also turn
        the car seats a different colour! 
            </p>

        <h1><i> WHAT THE FU</i> nction?!!!</h1>

            <p>A function is a chunk of javascript code which can be reused by wrapping it in a function. This allows you to just "call" that function
                instead of rewriting all the code again! 
            </p>
    
    
            <h3>Declaring a function</h3>
            <p>First thing you need to do is "delcare" the function. This gives it a name that you will use to call it (use it) 
                later on. Inside the curly brackets {} you will write the code you want to run when the function is called. You
                can also "pass" it variables which allow for the outcome of the function to be different depending on the variable/s
                passed.
    
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function myFunction(myVariable){
                        alert("You have run myFunction!" + myVariable);
                    }
    
                </code>
            </pre> 

    
            <h3>Calling a function</h3>
            <p>Throughout your application you may want to use that code you wrote previously when you "declared" your function.
                Because you did this you do not need to write all the "doing" code again, instead you just have to remember what
                you named it as and write that. With the below example if you had declared it as per above
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    myFunction("Fantastic!");   
                </code>
            </pre>   


            <p>The above code would display something like this!</p>
            <img src="images/alert.png" alt="picture of alert example">

        <h1>Control flow - what's that?!</h1>
            <p>Control flow is the order in which the code you write is executed. The order in which you write things matters and 
            if written in the wrong way can cause an outcome which you didn't expect or want!

            <h2>GOOD</h2>  
            In the below example I want to fill up my petrol tank only when it's empty because what a waste of time trying to fill up
            an already full tank<br>
            Below we can see that <i> fillUpPetrol </i> is called and run INSIDE the if statement to check to see if petrolTank is empty 
            and results in the car to only be filled up if the tank is empty. <br>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    var petrolTank = "empty"; <br>

                    function fillUpPetrol(){<br>
                        petrolTank = "full";<br>
                        console.log( "Petrol has been filled");
                    }<br>
        
                    
                    if (petrolTank == "empty"){<br>
                        fillUpPetrol();<br>
                    }
  
                </code>
              </pre>
            


            <h2>BAD</h2>
            In the below example fillUpPetrol is called and run before the if statement to check if the the petrol tank 
            is empty! Because it is done before we will always be trying to fill up a tank that's already full. <br>


            <pre>
                <code>
                    var petrolTank = "empty";<br>

                    function fillUpPetrol(){<br>
                        petrolTank = "full";<br>
                        return "Petrol has been filled";
                    }<br>
        
                    fillUpPetrol();<br>
        
                    if (petrolTank == "empty"){<br>
                        alert("Your tank is empty");
                    }<br>
                </code>
              </pre>

        <h1>Where is Javascript written</h1>
             <p>Similar to CSS you can have an external js file which is linked to your HTML or you can have it in the page. If you link 
                your HTML to an external javascript file best practice is to put it at the end of the file. (Just before the closing body
                tag). The reason for this is because of the way the browser reads your file (from top to bottom). If script tag is in the 
                head then when  your browser loads the HTML file it will wait until the JS file is loaded until continuing to process rest 
                of your HTMl.This could cause issues if your javascript does something on load to an element that has not yet been created 
                as broswer has not read that part of the document yet. Also, if your Javascript file is really complex it may affect the 
                load time of the page causing a worse user experience.

        <h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </h1>

        <h2>Arrays</h2>
        <p>An array is a list of different values.  </p>

        <pre>
            <code>

                var myArray = [];

                myArray.push("new array item");

                myArray[0]; //Accesses the first item in the array
        

            


            </code>
        </pre>  


        <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p>An object is a grouping of attributes which relate to a single "thing" </p>

        <pre>
            <code>

                var object = {
                    name: "value",
                    age: 12,
                    color: "blue",
                };


                var objectWithArray = {
                    name: "value",
                    age: 12,
                    color: "blue",
                    activities: ["swimming", "running", "biking", ]
                };

            </code>
        </pre> 


        <h2>What is the DOM and Dev Tools</h2>
        <p>The Document Object Model is a family tree like representation of the HTML elements on a page. HTML elements
            can be nested inside one another which the DOM sees as a child of that element. E.g. The H1 tag in the below example
            is nested inside of the body tag. The DOM sees the H1 as a child of body.

            <pre>
                <code>
                    &lt;body&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;
                    &lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;/body&gt;  
                </code>
            </pre>
