        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>


        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>For more complex programming tasks Pseudocode can really help to make sure what you are trying to achieve is clear in your mind
           and you understand the problem you are trying solve. It is written in plain english each step you are trying to achieve. In the video 
           I watched they mentioned that as you become more familiar with the language you are writing the code in you can start to complete the 
           Pseudocode in the coding language</p>



        <h2>Code Readability</h2>
        <p>I watched a useful video called "Writing Readable Code" which described some helpful tips to make your code more readable when future you
          or someone else on the same project needs to figure out what's going on.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep the line length 45-90 characters long - be mindful that different people have different set ups and while it might be easy to read on 
            your large work screen, someone else may use a much smaller screen and find it difficult to follow along.
          </li>
          <li>Try and write code that doesn't require a comment - by having the goal of your code not requiring a coment you strive to make it as naturally 
            readable as possible
          </li>
          <li>The following words are generic words that shouldnt be used in variable/function names as they are ambiguous - <i> check, validate, make, get/set, process, start </i></li>
          <li>Try and align with the way that existing code is already written - Generally you will be working on projects with other people, and with an existing code base. 
            By seeking to understand the way the code is currently written you can help to ensure consistency going forward.
          </li>  
        </ul>



        <h2>Console Log</h2>

        <p>Console log is great for determining what the value of variables are throughout your code when the value is changed by what your code does. It can help to narrow
          down where in the code the issue is if the output of the variable is not what your expect
        </p>
        

          <h3>Code Example</h3>


          <pre>
            <code>
              console.log(variableName)
            </code>
          </pre>



        <h3>Output Example</h3>

        <h2>Testing</h2>

        <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
        <p>With Test Driven Development (TDD) you write a test for your code before you even write it. In the video "Problem-Solving for Developers" the described the process as:
          Write a test that describes the expected output of the test. Write a failing test, implement code that pasts the test then optimise
          your code.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Write a test that checks the expected output of the test vs an actual output</li>
          <li>Write a failing test - this allows you think differently about the problem and ensure you understand it correctly</li>
          <li>Implement the code to pass the test</li>
          <li>Optimise your code - make it more efficent, increase code readability</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Example of when I used problem solving</h2>
        <p>In the katas this sprint I got stuck on the gradebook exercise. I struggled to get the test to pass for the average of value Joseph. I initially used console logging
          to try and see what values were being outputted as a result of my code. The code was returning back what I was expecting, I was stuck on it for hours and then decided 
          to post on the slack channel. I then realised maybe my understanding of the task was incorrect and it was at that point I realised I was writing the code for the test after 
          the one i was supposed to be working on.</p>


        <h2>Confidence levels</h2>
        <p>The katas have shown me the importance of understanding the problem first before coding it as there was a couple times where I interpreted the issue differently from what 
          I was required to do. I am confident in using console logging to narrow down where in the code it is not working
        </p>
