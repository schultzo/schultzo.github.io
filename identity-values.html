       <h2>My core personal values are</h2> 
       <ul>
        <li>Doing what’s right – I believe in doing the right thing and not pushing others down to get ahead</li>
        <li>Straightforwardness/Efficiency – I appreciate when outcomes are achieved in the most efficient way with as little 
            time/process delays as possible</li>
        <li>Making a positive difference – I think you should try and leave the world better than when you entered it </li>
        <li>Living a life I enjoy – I believe that you have to make sure that what you do you enjoy and you set your future self 
            up to enjoy life too</li>
        <li>Honesty – I believe that being honest important.</li>
 
    </ul>

My friend Zoe identified my values as adventure and curiosity  


<h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
</h2>

At work someone mentioned about how the order of the backlog was now out of order and was not sure why and what caused it.
 I wasn’t sure if it was me but I knew I had been reordering some other things which may have unintentionally caused the 
 backlog to become unordered. I raised my hand and said it was me who may have done it. I then reordered back to what it 
 had been previously. 

 <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>

I think growing up in a lower socioeconomic household has made be driven to be successful in life and ensure I don’t have to stress about money. It think it has also meant I am more risk adverse. I have a strong family backing which has meant a safety net in that sense that I haven’t felt stuck in a job or situation.


<h2>My strengths and weaknesses </h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<ul>
    <li>I can communicate well by giving context to an issue and looking at a situation from the perspective of another person    </li>
    <li>I am good at problem solving and finding trends in what is causing the issue. </li>
    <li>I am reliable and punctual – I have a knack for arriving exactly on time and if I say I am going to do something I will</li>
    <li>If I set myself a goal that I think will be difficult to meet I will throw myself 100% at it.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I am comfortable not having to interact with others which leads me to be very independent and not have to ask for help from others and become quite isolated. </li>
    <li>My motivation can fall into extremes where I can be super engaged in what I’m doing and spend a huge amount of time committing to achieving the goal or sometimes I can be very distracted
    </li>
    <li>I can become quite short/direct in tone when it comes to getting stuff done under pressure and I think while necessary at times its not as nice.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
</h2>
I think my problem solving skills and determination will be useful when encountering problems faced in the course. If engaged in a difficult challenge I will work as hard as I can to try and come up with a solution for it. I think I will need to push myself to not isolate myself and be comfortable being social.

<h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
</h2>
In a project at work it was important to keep the scope of the project really limited to ensure we would meet the timeframes set. Someone in the project kept discussing directly with the developer and putting in new requirements without consultation with myself as the Business Analyst. I discussed this with them and on reflection my frustration meant my tone was quite direct and probably unpleasant. I would try in future to better articulate why it was important to consult myself on any new requirements.


<h2>My achievements I am proud of</h2>
An achievement I am proud of is buying a van to live in for 6 months. I am proud of this because it meant taking a bit of risk of doing something a bit different to the norm and needing learn new things such as basic electrical and plumbing knowledge. 

I am proud of the beacons project I helped to deliver at work. It was a project that had a long history of not going well and I helped keep the scope contained, processes simple and deliver a lot of value.
