    <h1 class="EQ-IQ-Heading">EQ vs. IQ</h1>
    <p>
        EQ is a term in more recent years that has been thrown about. What is EQ? Is it the same as IQ? Read on to find out.

        <h1>What is EQ?</h1>
        <p>EQ is intelligence relating to emotions/relating to others rather than knowing how to do things or knowing a lot about
            a certain topic. Historically people have put more weighting behind someones IQ and underestimated the impact and power of 
            EQ
            <br>
            <br>

            Specifically EQ is about:

            <ul>
                <li>Identifying emotions</li>
                <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
                <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
                <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
                <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
                <li>Relating to others</li>
            </ul>

            In life a lot of is done with others, whether at work completing a project or at home a lot of life is done by working
            with others and having a high EQ allows for this to occur more effectively
        </p>



        <h1>Benefits of EQ in the world of programming</h1>

        <p>

        It is very unlikely that you will solely be working 100% alone. Whether you have customers, collegues, partners... chances are 
        you will have to interact with another human at some point! Having a higher EQ will allow you to get a better outcome from
        whatever you're working on with someone else.
        

        <div class="scenario-section">
        <h2>Scenario:</h2>
        <i> You are working on a project with a couple other Developers, a Project Manager and a Business Analyst. You are frustrated
        because what the Project Manager and Business Analyst are looking to achieve you feel is unrealistic with the expected 
        timeframe.</i>

        <h3>Approaching the situation Low EQ</h3>
        You stay quiet, internally letting your frustration boil inside. Because of the large amount of work you have to spend long days
        working which causes you to become overtired and make more mistakes which causes the Project Manager and Business Analyst to become frustrated.

        <h3>Approaching the situation with High EQ</h3>
        You calmly raise at an appropriate time your concerns with the required scope in the expected timeframes. You seek underestanding
        from the Project Manager and Business Analyst around why they are expecting this. Together through a discussion you realise
        that there is actually a much easier way of achieving the same outcome with a much simpler technical solution.

        <h1>How to get a higher EQ</h1>

        <p>EQ can be improved by the actions someone does every day. Like IQ it may feel some people natural ability but it is 
            something that can be worked on through mindfulness and taking proactive change in your day to day actions</p>


        <h2>Being Self Aware </h2>
            <p>By being aware yourself you are able to understand what subconsciously you may be communicating 
                to others. Being self aware involves being mindful of what your body is doing, what your mind is thinking,
                the tone, volume, and pace of your speech and what it is you are saying. By being self-aware it allows you to 
                become more intentional in your actions.
            </p>

        <h2>Use Active Listening</h2> 
        <p>When someone is talking seek to understand what they are trying to communicate. Not only through there words but also 
            from there non verbal communication such as body posture, their tone, their expression. Instead of thinking of what you 
            are going to say next try and seek to understand what the other person is inteding to communciate.
        </p>

        <h2>Be approachable</h2>
        <p>Be someone that someone WANTS to communicate with. If someone walks away from interacting with you feeling positive
            it is more likely they will want to interact with you again. 
        </p>
