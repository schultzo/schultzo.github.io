    <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I get nervous when having to video chat people for the first time - the listening and looping I found I 
            ended up dreading... not sure why I find it so nervewracking but I found myself dreading it but the people 
            I spoke with were lovely.
        </li>
        <li>
            When it comes to technical skills I found myself thinking something was really complicated and hesitant to
            start trying to cover it... only to find once broken down it actually wasn't too complicated! I think some
            tech jargon sounds really intense but then when you actually take time to work out what it is, it isn't too bad!
            The concept of "not yet" I think applies here
        </li>
        <li>
            I compare myself and abilities often to where people are and begin to feel stressed when I feel like I'm behind.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
    </h2>

    <p>Having only a technical understanding is not going to achieve the best result when you have to work in a team
        or with others. With empathy and self awareness you can ensure that you work in the best way with others to achieve 
        the best outcome. Also, by understanding what your values are you ensure that you make your actions align with who you are
        and your identity.
    </p>


   <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
   <p>How much I struggled having to read about the different topics in core learning - maybe I haven't read enough lately
       and am forgetting how to read! 
   </p>

   <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
   <p>The research - I found it hard to know whether a site I was on was reliable enough to include the information from on my blog.
       I found it took time to read through articles to make sure I picked out the general understanding and not just one websites
       interpretation.
   </p>

   <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development 
       bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>Because the end goal is to be able to complete programming projects either our own or in a developer role. By learning
        the core skills it helps us to better achieve this as its just not knowing the technical knowledge, we also need to apply
        that.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time 
        to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>

    <p>A little.. I think with some of the core topics I had already encountered before and while helpful I felt i was just
        relearning something I had already learnt. I would like to get more external opinions on my way of working and feedback.
        I have a perception of myself and how I interact with others and obstacles but itd be really useful to get more thoughts
        from others e.g. "when you do ABC, it makes people feel like XYZ" I get nervous about coming across as bossy or a know it all.
