        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is an umbrela term for the brains ability to change over time and throughout the individuals
            lifetime. It allows for the brain to form new connections or allow for pathways to be reformed after they become broken. 
            It creates new paths from what is already there - neurogenesis is the brains abiltiy to create new neurons.
        </p>

        <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: The term “neuroplasticity” was first used by Polish neuroscientist Jerzy Konorski in 1948</p>
    
        <h2>
            Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
        </h2>
        <p>The concept of neuroplasticity can benefit people in multiple ways, at its core the proof of neuroplasticity
          cant give hope to individuals who may have certain struggles that things have the potential to improve. The brain
          has the ability to "rewire" itself and forge new paths when other ones may have been broken from an illness or impact
          to the brain. It enables people to grow and recover. 
     
        </p>
         <h2> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
          <p>Personally, I have always disliked the saying "you can't teach an old dog new tricks", I've always been of 
            the belief that individuals can do whatever they want, possibly if you get older it gets harder as a certain way
            of being has become a more foundational part of your life but I do believe anyone can change if they really want to.
            For me I will be aware of thoughts/beliefs that I cannot change and try to recognise whether its a belief or fact.
          </p>

      

        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
          <p>With age you brains adaptability does reduce but it does not mean its not achievable to change your brains makeup.
            There are a number of ways to encourage your brain to forge these new paths 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Get enough quality sleep</li>
            <li>Continue learning </li>
            <li>Keep moving</li>
            <li>Reeduce Stress</li>
            <li>Find purpose</li>
            <li>Read a book</li>
          </ul>


         <h2>   
           Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
         </h2>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">Positive Psychology - Neuroplasticity</a> I liked this resource because
          it talked about the history of neuroplasticity</li>
         </ul>
         


        <h2>What is a growth mindset</h2>
        <p>
            Growth and fixed mindset is two different ways of looking at your approach to learning and life in general.
            A fixed mindset is one where you believe your current way of being is the way you are and that it wont change.
            It comes along with saying things like "I can't do that" "That's not how I do things" , "I like things this way".
            The alternative is a growth mindset whereby you are more open to the idea of learning, trying new things and that 
            your current being is not the extent of all you can be. <br> <br>

            For me I have been familar with growth vs fixed mindset before and I do consider myself for the most part to have a 
            growth mindset. There are certain areas which I do thing I'm more fixed in my beliefs but I think the first step is 
            recognising that and working on trying to change that. I think throughout my learning journey with Dev Academy I will
            need to continue to be mindful of when I may be experiencing a fixed mindset and working on actively changing that.

        <p>I like this resource where you have to try and identify who has a fixed mindset and who has a growth mindset.</p>
