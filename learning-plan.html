        <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
         <p>My long term goal is to be able to make a positive difference on the world through the use of tech. I like 
            the idea of projects like vaxx.nz and Time in the line where a technical solution can be made to improve a problem
            in the world. I'm still unsure around whether I want a full time developer role where I don't get to decide what to
            develop. I like the creative aspect of design so I think I would find it hard if that was taken away and was someone
            elses role to do.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Strengths:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>I can recognise when I am getting frustrated with something and need a break from it and can identify what
                is a worthwhile less frustrating task to do in the mean time.
            </li>
            <li>When I get stuck on something I don't give up and will try to come up with a solution</li>
            <li>I am organised and when struggling with something will attempt to become more structured with my learning by generally listing out what I am stuck with and breaking it out into 
                more managable chunks.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to understand the why and am more engaged in trying to figure out the problem if I want to achieve the 
                end result
            </li>
            <li>I doubt my ability to achieve some tasks - sometimes challenges can feel too technical and out of my depth but then I surprise myself when I manage to figure it out</li>
            <li>I find it difficult to visualise something just in my head and so I find it difficult to picture what it will 
                look like until I see it with my eyes. Also, with logic I feel like my brain sometimes makes something simple, super 
                complicated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <h3>Technical skills
        </h3>
        <p>I would like to be able to leave Dev Academy with enough knowledge to be able come up with a solution to a problem
            if I identify it. I don't expect to know everything but with enough knowledge that I would be able to figure it out
            for myself. I would really like to be able to be comfortable with using APIs from different sites so I can "play" with
            them and try doing cool things with them!</p>
        <h3> Non Technical skills</h3>

        <p> I would like to learn how to have more fun/be less serious while still achieving high results. I would also like to 
            feel more comfortable reaching out to new people and working with them.
        </p>

        <h2> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
            facilitators and industry/community representatives</h2>


        <p>I am going into bootcamp with the expectation that the courseload will be quite intensive and as such
            am expecting to dedicate majority of my time to this course. I may need to work a little throughout but 
            am limited to a maxiumum of 10hours a week.
        </p>

        <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        </h2>
        <p>I will try to be mindful of the rising stress levels and attempt to put it into perspective before it
             becomes too overwhelming. If I find myself stuck I will work on identifying what it is that is making me 
             stressed and break it down to find a way forward. I will communicate how I am going to the facilitators and reach
             out for support if I find I am needing it. I will also use exercise as a way to step a way from the problem and give my mind a break as to come back to the issue feeling
             more fresh
        </p>

        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
            If there is something I am stuck on I will first try and resolve by myself by trying to isolate the problem and 
            use online resources to troubleshoot what's going on. If I cannot resolve by myself I will reach out and ask another
            student for assistance. If still stuck I will seek the guidance from a facilitator.
        </p>

        <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
        <p>I would like to ensure what I am learning is Industry best practice and that if I am going off course in anyway they
            are able to advise me of this
        </p> 
            
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
            For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
            
        <p>
            I don't have any other commitments that I can forsee blocking me in some way - The course is my number one priority until it 
            finishes    
        </p>

        <p>For the foundations coursework I will make completion of this my priority each week. I will look ahead 
            at the following sprints and identify what sprints I may need to dedicate more time on and where I might

            <p>
            During foundations I will be still doing some part time work at maxiumum 10hours per week. I have advised work 
            that when I move down to Wellington it is unlikely that I will be able to work due to the workload.
