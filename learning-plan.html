            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?

            My long term goal is to be able to make a positive difference on the world through the use of tech. I like 
            the idea of projects like vaxx.nz and Time in the line where a technical solution can be made to improve something. 
            
            A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
            
            Strengths:
            I am motiviated to achieve goals when things are difficult. 

            Weaknesses:




            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

            Technical skills
            I would like to be able to leave Dev Academy with enough knowledge to be able come up with a solution to a problem
            if I identify it. I don't expect to know everything but with enough knowledge that I would be able to figure it out
            for myself.

            Non Technical skills
            I would like to learn how to have more fun/be less serious while still achieving high results.


            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
            facilitators and industry/community representatives

            For the foundations coursework I will make completion of this my priority each week. I will look ahead 
            at the following sprints and identify what sprints I may need to dedicate more time on and where I might 
            be familiar with the content.
            
            
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
            
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            If there is something I am stuck on I will first try and resolve by myself by trying to isolate the problem and 
            use online resources to troubleshoot what's going on. If I cannot resolve by myself I will post of the foundations channel or during bootcamp
            ask another student for assistance. If still stuck I will seek the guidance from a facilitator.
            
            
            A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
            Industry best practice
            Advise if I'm going astray
            
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
            For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.

            During foundations I will be still doing some part time work at maxiumum 10hours per week. I have advised work 
            that when I move down to Wellington it is unlikely that I will be able to work due to the workload.
