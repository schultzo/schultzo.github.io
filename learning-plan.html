        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h2>

        <p>My long term goal is to be able to make a positive difference on the world through the use of tech. I like 
            the idea of projects like vaxx.nz and Time in the line where a technical solution can be made to improve a problem
            in the world. 
        </p>

        <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
        </h2>

        <h3>Strengths:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>I am motiviated to achieve goals when things are difficult. 
            </li>
            <li>When I get stuck on something I don't give up and will try to come up with a solution</li>
            <li>I am organised and when struggling with something will attempt to become more structured with my learning by generally listing out what I am stuck with and breaking it out into 
                more managable chunks.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I can struggle to stop thinking about a particular problem and get frustrated with minimal progress</li>
            <li>I doubt my ability to achieve some tasks - sometimes challenges can feel too technical and out of my depth but then I surprise myself when I manage to figure it out</li>
            <li>I find it difficult to visualise something just in my head and so I find it difficult to picture what it will look like until I see it with my eyes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <h3>Technical skills
        </h3>
        <p>I would like to be able to leave Dev Academy with enough knowledge to be able come up with a solution to a problem
            if I identify it. I don't expect to know everything but with enough knowledge that I would be able to figure it out
            for myself.</p>
        <h3> Non Technical skills</h3>

        <p> I would like to learn how to have more fun/be less serious while still achieving high results.
        </p>

        <h2> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
            facilitators and industry/community representatives</h2>


        <p>For the foundations coursework I will make completion of this my priority each week. I will look ahead 
            at the following sprints and identify what sprints I may need to dedicate more time on and where I might 
            be familiar with the content.</p>
       
        
        

        <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        </h2>
        <p>I will try to be mindful of the rising stress levels and attempt to put it into perspective before it becomes too overwhelming. If I find myself stuck I will
            work on identifying what it is that is making me stressed and break it down to find a way forward. I will communicate how I am going to the facilitators and reach
            out for support if I find I am needing it. I will also use exercise as a way to step a way from the problem and give my mind a break as to come back to the issue feeling
            more fresh
        </p>

            
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>If there is something I am stuck on I will first try and resolve by myself by trying to isolate the problem and 
            use online resources to troubleshoot what's going on. If I cannot resolve by myself I will post of the foundations channel or during bootcamp
            ask another student for assistance. If still stuck I will seek the guidance from a facilitator.
            </p>
        
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
        <p>Industry best practice
        Advise if I'm going astray</p> 
            
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
            For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
            
            <p>
            During foundations I will be still doing some part time work at maxiumum 10hours per week. I have advised work 
            that when I move down to Wellington it is unlikely that I will be able to work due to the workload.
