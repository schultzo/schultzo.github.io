    <h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning? </h1>

    <p>Overall there are 5 different positioning values for the "Position" property.
        <ul>
            <li>static</li>
            <li>relative</li>
            <li>fixed</li>
            <li>absolute</li>
            <li>sticky</li>
        </ul>

    In this article I will cover the relative, absolute and fixed values and their effect on how changing to these could
    effect your webpage.
    </p>    


    <p>In the world of web everything is made up of containers which are positioned on a screen which is displayed 
        to the user. Out of the box the way these containers are layed out depends on the order in which you write your
        code using the default styling for each tag. For a better experience we may want certain elements to display 
        in ways that are the default positioning. This is when we can use the "Position" property in CSS to explicitly
        state how we want the element to positioned on the screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Fixed</h2>


    <h2>Relative</h2>
    <p>When something has position:relative it will be positioned relative to where it would be positioned 
       if no explicit positioning was applied. The effect on the other elements is that it will leave a space where
       that element used to be </p>


    <h2>Absolute</h2>
    <p>it ABSOLUTELY must be positioned exactly as the developer as stated. If the developer writes: left:200px; that 
        item must be 200px away from the left regardless of how it would be otherwise positioned. The effect on the other 
        elements is though the absolute positioned element was never there.
